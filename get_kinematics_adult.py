Created on Wed Mar 11 13:45:21 2020
Analyzes the kinematics of real fish data from VR experiments
Includes code for:
    - getting speed and orientation from position (getSpeed, getOri)
    - smoothing and finding jumps/anomalies in data (cleanData)
    - identifying burst-glide information and getting fits for each burst (getBGCycle)
    - getting the distribution of turn angles around each burst (getTurns)
    - finding periods of activity vs inactivity over the experiment (getSwimTime)
